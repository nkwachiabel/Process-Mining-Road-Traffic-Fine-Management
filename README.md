# Process Discovery and Conformance Checking: Road Traffic Fine Management

This repository contains a data analytics project that utilizes process mining methodology to analyse the real-life event log of an information system managing road traffic fines in Italy. The dataset was gotten from [here](https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:270fd440-1057-4fb9-89a9-b699b47990f5) and it contains fines created between 1st January 2000 to 17 June 2013.

# Data collection
The initial event log consisted of 150370 cases between 1 January 2000 and 17 June 2013, spread over the years. The case column was used as the case ID. The event column was used as the activities and contained the following activities:
- <b>Create fine</b>: The date the fine was created.
- <b>Send fine</b>: The date the fine is sent to the offender
- <b>Insert fine notification</b>: The date offender is notified about the fine (i.e., when the fine is dropped at the post office)
- <b>Add penalty</b>: If the fine is not paid in 60 days from the creation, a penalty is added. This is the date the penalty is added
- <b>Payment</b>: When the fine is paid. Note that a fine can be paid multiple times in installment
- <b>Send for credit collection</b>: After 180 days, if the fine is not paid, it is sent to the credit collection agency
- <b>Insert date appeal to prefecture</b>: The date the offender decides to appeal the fine to the prefecture 
- <b>Send appeal to prefecture</b>: The date the offender sends the appeals the fine to the prefecture
- <b>Receive result appeal from prefecture</b>: The date the offender receives the result of the appeal from the prefecture
- <b>Notify result appeal to offender</b>: The date the offender is notified of the result of the appeal (similar to Insert fine notification above)
- <b>Appeal to judge</b>: The date the offender appeals to a judge.

The dataset contains other attributes such as the amount (the offender has to pay), expense (the amount paid in sending the fine), paymentAmount (the amount the offender paid), totalPaymentAmount(the total amount the offender has paid), vehicle class (the class of the vehicle), article (the road article that was violated), etc.

# Data quality check and transformation
The event log was reviewed to ensure the data contained were okay to use for process mining. The following was discovered:
1. Python did not automatically identify the date column. This was fixed subsequently.
2. Some columns had empty values. This was because certain activities require input in those columns while some do not. For example, expense column is filled only when the send fine activity is done.
3. The org:resource column which indicates the user who performed a particular activity was constant through out the case. Therefore, it was not possible to check for disaggregation of duties or handover of work.
4. Since the event log was gotten online, no process owner was contacted to gain further understanding of the process and other columns in the dataset. Therefore, if there are manual events in this process, it is not highlighted here.
5. In analysing, it is important to use completed cases. The event log was filtered for those cases that either ends in Payment, sent for credit collection or dismissed following a successful appeal. After filtering for the completed cases, we were left with 128,268 events.

# Output and Visualisations
## Data overview
![alt text]()

This gives an overview of the dataset. It shows the number of fines, and events and the total fine amount from these events. The stacked column chart at the top right shows the number of fines per year and the vehicle class. It is apparent that the users od vehicle class A are the most frequent traffic offenders.

The points by article number table shows that while Article 157, 7 and 158 are the most frequent articles violated, article 142 and 158 are the violations which result in most most points decucted. This is because Article 142 relates to Speeding tickets and Article 157/158 relates to parking fines.

## Process discovery based on event log data
![alt text]()
---------------------------------------------------
The Graphviz library was used to automatically generate a visual process model based on the event log data. 
1. <b>Variant analysis</b>: This variant analysis shows how frequently a particular process is followed. There was a total 193 variants with the top 5 variants acconting for 93% of the cases.
2. <b>Events chart</b>: This shows when the events occur by the time of the week. It shows that most fines are created either on a Friday or Saturday (TGIFðŸ˜„), payments were made on either a Monday or Tuesday and fines are sent for credit collection mostly on Tuesday or Sunday.
3. <b>Process graph</b>: The process graph shows how the activity flows from the start of a procurement process to the end. From the process graph, all cases starts with the Creation of a fine. For Variant 2 cases, the offender pays the fine immediately it is created. Variant 2 accounts for approximately 36% of all cases. This maybe because for cases in Variants 2, these fines are paid immediately they are given. For other variants, after the case is created, it is sent to the offender and they are either paid or sent for credit collection.
4. <b>Events transition matrix</b>: The transition matrix shows how the events are been handed over from one to another and how frequently this occurs.
### Process deviation
* <b>Dismissal variables used</b>: The dismissal variable based on research to be used are either NIL (when the fine is created and should bot be changed unless there is a successful appeal), G (when there is a successful appeal and the case is dismissed by the judge), and # (when there is a successful appeal and the case is dismissed by the prefect). However, there were other dismissal variable that were found in the event log. They are detailed below:
  * <b>Dismissal variable 4</b>: This dismissal variable appears in only 2 cases and used in one article (142). Used by 2 users (User 53 and User 11) for fines created in August and December 2004 and occurs in 2 variants (Variant 3 and Variant 4)
  * <b>Dismissal variable @</b>: This dismissal variable appears in 9 cases and two variants (Variant 1 and variant 8), used by 7 users (User 537, 550, 35, 8, 29, 31, and 536). All fines were created between January 3 and June 3 2000. Article 7, 157 & 158.
  * <b>Dismissal variable D</b>: Used once for the case created on 2 June 2011 by User 848. Appears in one case. Aritcle 158.
  * <b>Dismissal variable Z</b>: Used once for the case created on June 16 2000 by user 811.
* <b>Create fine dismissal variable</b>: When a fine is created, the dismissal value is NIL. While the NIL variable is used for almost all cases in this activity, the dismissal variable 4, was used 2x, @ was used 9x, D and Z were used 1x.
* <b>Successful dismissal</b>: As highlighted above, there are some cases where the successful dismissal variable is used (G and #) but those cases do not end with Send appeal to judge or prefecture.
* <b>Receive result appeal from prefecture</b>: This activity is usually done when the appeal to the prefecture was not successful and should have a NIL dismissal variable. Below, there are 24 cases where a # variable was used instead.
### Other findings
* There are some users that carry out particular events in batches. For example, users 538, 550 and 536 performed the Send fine activity for 259, 195 and 176 cases respectively on 19 May 2003. Also, the three users performed the Insert fine notification activity 100, 69 and 65 times respectively on 25 May 2003.

## Performance analysis
![alt text](https://github.com/nkwachiabel/Procure_to_Pay/blob/main/Images/Performance%20analysis.jpg?raw=true)

Process performance metrics such as cycle time, and lead time were calculated for each activity or process step. Lead time provides the information of a duration of an event until another activity is performed.
1. The average duration in days graph shows which event takes more time on an average. It shows that more time is spent on the <i>1st approval</i> activity and <i>Document Date</i> activity and the least amount on time is spent on the <i>2nd approval</i> activity.
2. The transition matrix shows the average time it spends moving from one activity to another. The transition matrix shows that it takes an average of 32 days from <i>Document Date</i> activity to <i>1st approval</i>. It takes an average of 7 days from the <i>Invoice Received</i> activity to the <i>Payment performed</i>.
3. The case duration graph shows that a lot of the cases are completed within 30 days. However, there are some outliers where cases lasts more that 200 days.
4. <b>Payments</b>: There were 140 cases amounting to $501k which were paid late. There are 400 payments amounting to $383k which are recurring (same Vendor, same amount). Majority of these recurring payments (103) were paid to <i>Vendor 401972</i>.

# Process improvement
Based on the analysis, areas for improvement were identified such as:
* Process redesign: Due to the lack of approval for majority of these payments, the procurement process should be redesigned to ensure that all payments are pre-approved. This is important to ensure segregation of duties and reduce the possibility of fraud. At least, there should be a limit on the amount that can be paid without approval and a limit when both 1st and 2nd approval is needed. It was noted that when a procurement needs to be reversed, a new process is initiated. The process should be redesigned such that the actual procurement raised should be reversible. This will enable proper monitoring of these requests. Regarding recurring payments, further investigation should be carried out especially on those recurring payments without approval. On the other hand, a separate process for recurring process can be designed such that it needs to be approved initially before the first payment.
* Reducing approval delays: It takes an average of 4 days for the 2nd approver to carry out their task after the 1st approver is done. This causes unnecessary delays to these requests. It is recommended to set come up with maybe a notification to always remind the 2nd approver that a request is pending.
* Avoid weekend payments: There were 6 instances where a payment was peformed on a weekend. This can be a fraud indicator. It is important to put in place system blockers to avoid instances such as this unless absolutely necessary.
* Performance monitoring: A lot of time is spend between some activities such as Document Date. Lastly, a performance monitoring process should be put in place to track KPIs relating to the procurement process.
